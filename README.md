# 🦀 My Rust Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to learning the **Rust** programming language.

This repository serves as a dev log containing my notes, solved exercises, and experiments based on the official [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) guide. My goal is to deeply understand Rust's unique concepts (Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes) through practice.

## 📚 About this project

I am following the "Rust by Example" manual chapter by chapter.

## 🚀 Progression (Rust by Example)

I track my progress through the manual's chapters here:

- [x] **1. Hello World** (Formatted print, Debug)
- [x] **2. Primitives** (Tuples, Arrays, Slices)
- [ ] **3. Custom Types** (Structures, Enums)
- [ ] **4. Variable Bindings** (Scope, Shadowing)
- [ ] **5. Types** (Casting, Literals, Inference)
- [ ] **6. Conversion** (`From`, `Into`, `TryFrom`)
- [ ] **7. Expressions**
- [ ] **8. Flow of Control** (`if/else`, `loop`, `while`, `for`, `match`)
- [ ] **9. Functions** (Methods, Closures, HOF)
- [ ] **10. Modules**
- [ ] **11. Crates**
- [ ] **12. Cargo** *(Skipped / Theory only)*
- [ ] **13. Attributes**
- [ ] **14. Generics** (Bounds, Where clauses)
- [ ] **15. Scoping Rules** (RAII, Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes) 🔥 *The hard part*
- [ ] **16. Traits** (Derive, Dyn, Ops)
- [ ] **17. Macro Rules!**
- [ ] **18. Error Handling** (`Option`, `Result`, `?`)
- [ ] **19. Std Library Types** (Box, Vector, String, HashMap)
- [ ] **20. Std Misc** (Threads, Channels, File I/O)
- [ ] **21. Testing**
- [ ] **22. Unsafe Operations**

## 🛠️ How to run the code

Since I am not using Cargo, I compile and run each file manually using the Rust compiler.

**1. Compile the file:**
```bash
rustc filename.rs
2. Run the executable:

On Linux/macOS:

Bash

./filename
On Windows:

DOS

.\filename.exe
```
 
 ## Personal Notes & Tipsace reserved for random notes, useful commands, or "gotchas".

Always read the compiler error messages; they are incredibly helpful in Rust.

rustc --explain E0XXX helps understand specific error codes.
